The basic assumptions of the game are that the player has a large amount of skills improving during use and generate dungeons from previously defined segments so that each time the player can try on a different board. Game have a lot of potential and interesting features. Currently still in demo version.

Currently status : Playable, i expect bugs to be found ( May be still unbalanced )
